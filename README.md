# stalld

The stalld program (which stands for 'stall daemon') is a
mechanism to prevent the *starvation* of operating system threads in a
Linux system. The premise is to start up on a *housekeeping* cpu (one
that is not used for real-application purposes) and to periodically
monitor the state of each thread in the system, looking for a thread
that has been on a run queue (i.e. ready to run) for a specifed length
of time without being run. This condition is usually hit when the
thread is on the same cpu as a high-priority cpu-intensive task and
therefore is being given no opportunity to run.

When a thread is judged to be starving, stalld changes
that thread to use the SCHED_DEADLINE policy and gives the thread a
small slice of time for that cpu (specified on the command line). The
thread then runs and when that timeslice is used, the thread is then
returned to its original scheduling policy and stalld then
continues to monitor thread states.

There is now an experimental option to boost using SCHED_FIFO. This
logic is used if the running kernel does not support the
SCHED_DEADLINE policy and may be forced by using the -F/--force_fifo
option.

## Command Line Options

`Usage: stalld [-l] [-v] [-k] [-s] [-f] [-h] [-F]
          [-c cpu-list]
          [-p time in ns] [-r time in ns]
          [-d time in seconds] [-t time in seconds]`

### Logging options
- -l/--log_only: only log information (do not boost) [false]
- -v/--verbose: print info to the std output [false]
- -k/--log_kmsg: print log to the kernel buffer [false]
- -s/--log_syslog: print log to syslog [true]

### Startup options
- -c/--cpu: list of cpus to monitor for stalled threads [all cpus]
- -f/--foreground: run in foreground [false but true when -v]
- -P/--pidfile: write daemon pid to specified file [no pidfile]

### Boosting options
- -p/--boost_period: SCHED_DEADLINE period [ns] that the starving task will receive [1000000000]
- -r/--boost_runtime: SCHED_DEADLINE runtime [ns] that the starving task will receive [20000]
- -d/--boost_duration: how long [s] the starving task will run with SCHED_DEADLINE [3]
- -F/--force_fifo: force using SCHED_FIFO for boosting

### Monitoring options
- -t/--starving_threshold: how long [s] the starving task will wait before being boosted [60]
- -A/--aggressive_mode: dispatch one thread per run queue, even when there is no starving
                          threads on all CPU (uses more CPU/power). [false]
### Miscellaneous
- -h/--help: print this menu
